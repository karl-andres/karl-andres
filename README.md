### About Me

I'm a second-year Software Engineering student at [**McMaster University**](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), currently involved in technical clubs like [**McMaster EcoCAR**](https://www.macecocar.ca/) and [**MAC RoboMaster**](https://macrobomaster.com/) where I work with systems using C++, Python, and tools like CMake and ROS.

Iâ€™m passionate about full-stack development and currently exploring AI/ML, with ongoing projects that combine both areas, including a music generation app that integrates machine learning models for creative output. I enjoy experimenting with different frameworks, and deploying scalable applications that merge intelligence and usability.

Outside of tech, I practice taekwondo, play guitar, and play an unhealthy amount of games. I value creativity, discipline, and problem-solving, whether Iâ€™m writing code, composing music, or learning new martial arts techniques.
